This is a booking system designed for the bookings that need to be done for the welcomming weeks. 
The goal with this project is to make the whole process easier for everyone involved by designing a web-based booking system where each welcoming commitee makes their wished bookings. The system then automatically detects clashes with other commitees and and warns the user so that they can change their booking or discuss the clash with the other welcoming commitee. 

The project uses the MERNG Stack aswell as Typescript in the backend.
