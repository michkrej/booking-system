# Booking System

## Description

This booking system was developed to be used for making room and area bookings for the reception at LiU by all faculties to facilitate collision management. The groups book their rooms and areas through a calendar, after which they can identify collisions between themselves and other groups.

A collision can occur when:
- Two or more groups want the same room/area during overlapping time
- Two or more groups want certain materials and exceed the maximum capacity together.
